* Rewrite expression evaluator for RUN tokenized code. PARTIAL, ALMOST THERE...
* Recheck ALL PRINT tests, interpreted and compiled.
* Recheck all variable references, interpreted and compiled.
* Recheck use of colon for multiple commands in line, for all implemented keywords.
* Reimplement LIST for tokenized code.
* Eliminate unnecessary defaults in switch constructs.
* See error 'ERROR[1]: (PARSERR17) EXPECTED END OF LINE' for 'PRINT 1,'
  there is no space between error message and new prompt.
  Same for 'ERROR[8]: (PARSERR1) NUMBER PARSE ERROR'

* Fix PRINT variants (empty args, semicolon, etc.) SEEMS OK, NEEDS TESTING.
